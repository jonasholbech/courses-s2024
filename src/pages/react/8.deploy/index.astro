    <h2>A few extra details</h2>
    <p><code>npm run build</code> is the command needed to build</p>
    <p class="fragment">
      That will create a folder called <code>dist/</code> or <code>.next/</code>
      with the minified/optimized code
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
      If you're using Vite you can upload it to your own domain, but you
      probably need to tell React to use relative paths
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">
      Do that by adding the following to <code>package.json</code>: <code
        >"homepage": ".",</code
      >
    </p>
    <p class="fragment">If you're using Next, your own domin won't work</p>
